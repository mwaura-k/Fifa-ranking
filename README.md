## Specify question

Make a prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training)

### The project will be succesful when:

We make a prediction of the game results between team 1 and 2 based on if the team is home or away and if the game is friendly or not.

The model used will achieve at least 75% accuracy.

## Record experimental design

a) Loading data

b) Data cleaning

c) Merging

d) Perform your EDA

e) Perform any necessary feature engineering

f) Check of multicollinearity

g) Build the model

h) Cross-validate the model

i) Compute RMSE

j) Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlettâ€™s test
